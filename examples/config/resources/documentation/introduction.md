# Introduction to the Model Context Protocol

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard protocol designed to enhance the capabilities of AI models by providing access to external tools, resources, and state management. MCP enables AI models to interact with the outside world in a controlled, secure manner.

## Key Features of MCP

- **Tool Execution**: Models can call external tools to perform calculations, fetch data, or modify state
- **Resource Access**: Models can read from resources like documentation, user data, or system information
- **State Management**: Models can maintain state across interactions
- **Standard Interface**: MCP defines a standard way for models and tools to interact

## About this Server

This server implements the MCP specification, providing a set of tools and resources that can be used by compatible AI models. Some key features:

- **Configurable**: All tools, resources, and prompts are defined in configuration files
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools, resources, or prompts
- **Standards-compliant**: Follows the MCP specification for compatibility with any MCP client

## Getting Started

To use this server:

1. Configure your tools, resources, and prompts in the config directory
2. Start the server with `yarn start --config path/to/config`
3. Connect an MCP-compatible client to the server

## Available Components

The server comes with several built-in components:

- **Tools**: Utilities for performing calculations, transformations, and other operations
- **Resources**: Documentation, reference materials, and other static or dynamic content
- **Prompts**: Templates for generating structured prompts for AI models
