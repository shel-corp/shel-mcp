# Test Resource Collection

This is a README file for the test resource collection, which is used in unit tests.

## About this Collection

## Files in this Collection

- `test-file.txt`: A plain text file
- `test-file.md`: A Markdown file

1. The README.md file is correctly processed for resource description
2. All files in the directory are properly loaded as resources
3. File content types are correctly identified
