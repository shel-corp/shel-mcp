{{else}}
**Expected Behavior**: Please help identify what the correct behavior should be.
{{/if}}

{{#if context}}
**Additional Context**: {{context}}
{{/if}}

{{#if environment_info}}
**Environment Information**: {{environment_info}}
{{/if}}

## Debug Analysis Level

{{#if debug_level}}
**Analysis Type**: {{debug_level}}
{{else}}
**Analysis Type**: Thorough analysis with step-by-step debugging
{{/if}}

## Debugging Requirements

Please provide a comprehensive debugging analysis that includes:

### 1. Problem Identification
- Root cause analysis of the issue
- Specific line(s) where the problem occurs
- Type of bug (logic error, syntax error, runtime error, etc.)
- Severity assessment (critical, major, minor)

### 2. Error Analysis
- Detailed explanation of why the error occurs
- Trace through the problematic code execution
- Identify contributing factors
- Analysis of error propagation

### 3. Impact Assessment
- What functionality is affected
- Potential side effects or cascading issues
- Data integrity concerns
- Performance implications

### 4. Debugging Strategy
- Step-by-step debugging approach
- Key variables/states to monitor
- Breakpoint recommendations
- Logging suggestions for investigation

### 5. Multiple Solution Options
- **Quick Fix**: Immediate workaround or patch
- **Proper Fix**: Correct long-term solution
- **Robust Fix**: Enhanced solution with error prevention
- Trade-offs between different approaches

### 6. Code Corrections
- Corrected version of the problematic code
- Line-by-line explanation of changes
- Before/after comparison
- Verification that the fix addresses the root cause

### 7. Prevention Strategies
- How to avoid similar issues in the future
- Code review checkpoints
- Testing strategies to catch this type of bug
- Best practices to implement

### 8. Testing Recommendations
- Unit tests to verify the fix
- Integration tests for related functionality
- Edge cases to test
- Regression testing suggestions

## Debugging Checklist

Please verify and address:

### Common Bug Categories
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect algorithms or conditions
- **Runtime Errors**: Null references, array bounds, type mismatches
- **Concurrency Issues**: Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety
- **Memory Issues**: Leaks, buffer overflows, improper allocation
- **Integration Problems**: API misuse, dependency conflicts
- **Configuration Issues**: Environment variables, settings, permissions

### Code Quality Issues
- **Input Validation**: Missing or inadequate validation
